## Projects
### Movie Recommendation System
[Publication](https://github.com/emre-02/movie-recommendation-system)

This project is a Streamlit application built using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to develop a content-based recommendation system. The system works on the [TMDB 5000](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) Movie Dataset and recommends similar content to users. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) matrix calculation, Calculating similarity scores using Cosine Similarity, User-friendly experience with Streamlit interface, It has details such as a real-time recommendation system.

[Publication](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yunusemreoztrk/mobile-games-a-b-testing)

A/B Testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) is used to compare two versions (Control and Action) of a product, content, or feature to determine which one performs better based on metrics such as conversion rates, click-through rates, or user engagement. Using A/B testing on the  [Mobile Games: A/B Testing](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yufengsui/mobile-games-ab-testing) dataset, players' interactions between weeks were observed.
